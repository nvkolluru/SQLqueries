-- WHICH GETS ONLY SINGLE COLUMN VALUES
SELECT KEYNAME

(
SELECT KEYNAME,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Id) AS ROW# FROM TABLENAME
) AS T

**OTHER WAY**
-- WHICH GETS ALL RECORDS 

SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY ID ASC) AS ROW#, rx.*  FROM  TABLE TL WHERE TL.ID < 30)
WHERE ROW# BETWEEN 10 AND 20;


// We have OFFSET and FETCH NEXT key words in MSSQL but not it SQL. Hence, we use derived tables concept
